## ‚ö† About this widget

I made this specifically for **Kyiv**, where I live, so it‚Äôs tuned for my setup.  
If you want to use it for another location, you‚Äôll need to **change the `locationUID` manually**.

Honestly, I made it mostly for myself, so it‚Äôs **not polished for general use**‚Äîbut feel free to tinker with it.
